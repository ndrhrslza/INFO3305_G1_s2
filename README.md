 ## Introduction of the proposed web application. 

   We have decided to create an effective Restaurant Reservation System as we knew the importance of providing exceptional service, and ensuring a smooth dining experience for guests is our main priority. That is the reason why we want to develop a cutting-edge reservation system that simplifies the reservation process, maximizes table utilization, and enhances customer satisfaction. 

   Our Restaurant Reservation System is designed to revolutionize the way we manage reservations, empowering us to efficiently handle bookings, optimize seating arrangements, and deliver personalized service to our valued customers. 
   

## The objective of the proposed web application. 

  The restaurant reservation management system aims to allow customers to reserve their tables online, as it enables them to see any tables and times that are still available. This may ease customers by saving them time and making them more efficient. Plus, this system is used to keep the restaurant functioning by tracking customer reservations to avoid any overlapping reservations between customers happen. Moreover, this system can acknowledge managers or staff to keep customers informed by streamlining seating, managing table turnover, and estimating wait times. This improves the visitor experience and keeps the employees organized. Thus, the restaurant will be able to provide better service by better-controlling workflow through reservations. Therefore, by creating the restaurant reservation management system, we proposed this project to achieve the following objectives. 


## Features and functionalities of the proposed web application.
  **1.  Insert new record for reservation**
   - Customer and staff can fill in form for reservation, by inserting
  email, time and capacity.
  
  **2. Updating/edit record for reservation, customer and table**
   - Alter reservation information in case of customer request for
  different timing, capcacity and table number.
  
  **3. Deleting past records**
   - Staff can delete past records of customer reservation and delete
  cancelled reservation.
  
  **4. Updating/edit record for menu**
   - Staff can add, edit or delete menu available.
